### Hi there 👋

<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=23786" width='300px'>

I am _NSObject (23786)_, a Grade-Eight student macOS developer and competitive programmer (OIer) studying in Shanghai Huayu Junior Middle School.

🔭 I am interested in the Swift Programming Language, and I've developed some macOS applications with Swift. I am currently working on project [C+++ IDE](https://www.github.com/23786/Cppp-IDE), which is an IDE for competitive programming on macOS.

💬 My blog website is at <http://nsobjectzyx.oier.cloud/> (new) and <http://www.nsobjectzyx.tk/> (old).

🏫 I am currently busy with my studies, so the contribution frequency is low, but I will continue coding when I am free~
